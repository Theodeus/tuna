Tuna.js is supposed to be an open source effort, so all pull requests are welcome. We're always looking for more effects, but there's a need for tests as well. Any other creative ideas are also welcome, of course.

The intent of the project is to create an extensive library of audio effects that can be used in any Web Audio application. There's no intent to do more than that.

If you've created an application that uses Tuna - feel free to add a pull request to add a link and short description of you application in the main README.md file!

Tuna.js began as a hobby project of mine, @Theodeus, and were eventually brought in under the @Dinahmoe umbrella. The framework was further developed at @Dinahmoe, with the help of Alessandro Saccoia, while I was working there and finally released as open source as Jam With Chrome launched. The project then stagnated for a while until I left @Dinahmoe and was graciously allowed to keep maintaining the project.

Along with me is @tencircles who's the current Technical Director at @Dinahmoe, and @alesaccoia, freelancing DSP guru.
